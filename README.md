# chess-clone
This is a project intended to continue my journey learning javascript. My goal is to create a working PvPC game of chess. (self learning project)


Done:

- Create boilerPlate for script/style/index.
- Make script to create gameBoard.
- Add basic style to gameBoard.
- Create game pieces.
- Add addresses to each space.
- make pieces selectable.
- Highlight selected piece and remove highlight when a piece isn't selected.


Current tasks:
- When a piece is selected highlight legal placements with yellow.
- Make a pawn able to move.


Future To Do:

- create a turn based system that swaps control between white and black.
- create a capture mechanic.
